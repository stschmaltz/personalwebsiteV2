      "As I neared four years at Replicon, I felt that I was ready for another challenge and switched companies to Osprey Informatics. Replicon was a midsize company with 500 employee and Osprey was about 20 when I joined. It's been incredibly different and also a period of rapid growth for me. I do EmberJS and am the primary front-end developer, effectively taking ownership of much of the front-end",
